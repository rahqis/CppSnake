# C++ Terminal Snake Game

The follow repo is a snake game compatible with Linux/Mac machines. This application is meant to be a practice for C++.

The goal of this project is to code the game in a variety of ways.
The first is a simple, non Object-oreinted terminal application.
The second, which is in development, is an object-oriented terminal application.
And in the future, I intend on developing the game using a game engine.

## Non Object Oriented Approach

For the first application, you can start by changing your directory into the repository and type the following commands in the terminl.

```
$ g++ main.cpp -o main
$ ./main
```

The game keeps score, and utilizes the awsd approach instead of using the arrow keys and is terminated when hitting yourself a wall.

Enjoy!
